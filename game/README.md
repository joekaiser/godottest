projects developed with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

Usage
-----

Copy the `logger.gd` file in your project folder, and define it as an autoloaded
singelton in your project's settings (e.g. with the name *Logger*).

singelton.

Read the code for details about the API, it's extensively documented.
